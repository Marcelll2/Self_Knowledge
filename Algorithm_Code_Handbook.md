### Xiaomi

This is a variant of the **edit distance** problem, with an additional rule: if the **same type of operation** (e.g., consecutive insertions, consecutive deletions) is performed repeatedly, starting from the second operation, the cost of each subsequent operation is halved (rounded down).For example:

- The total cost of 3 consecutive insertions is 1+0+0=1

- The total cost of 2 consecutive substitutions is 1+0=1
